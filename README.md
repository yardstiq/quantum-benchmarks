# Quantum Software Benchmarks

We benchmark several popular quantum computation softwares/frameworks/simulators to test their performance
in practical daily research.

This benchmark is written with the following principles:

- try to use the user interface (UI) instead of high performance hack from internals.
- focus on laptop runnable scale (4-25 qubits) instead of High Performance Cluster scale

The complete results are included in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md)

## Installation

You should be able to run this benchmark with the `bin/benchmark` script.

```
    Quantum Circuit Simulation Benchmark

install                 install dependencies
run [package]           run benchmark of [package] or run all benchmarks by default
parallel [package]      spawn [package] benchmark in a process or run all benchmark in parallel by default
help                    print this message
```

### Requirements

- [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Julia 1.0+](https://julialang.org/)
- [CUDA Toolkit (optional)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) for benchmarking CUDA backend

Make sure you have the above required dependency installed, then run the following script, which will install
all the dependencies for you in a new environment.

```sh
bin/benchmark install
```

## Run Benchmark

```sh
bin/benchmark benchmark
```

This will usually take a few hours to finish, thus if you want to run it in the backend, you can use `parallel` instead of `benchmark`.
Afterwards, you can generate the plot by running:

```sh
bin/plot
```
